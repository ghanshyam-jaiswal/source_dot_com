* git : The git commit -a command is a convenient shortcut in Git that allows you to stage and commit all changes to tracked files in your working directory in a single step. Here's what it does:
<< git commit -am "Committing all changes to tracked files" >>(git commit -a does not commit newly created files (untracked files). To commit new files, you still need to use git add to stage them first, or you can combine git commit -a with -m flag to add a commit message directly in the command line.)
